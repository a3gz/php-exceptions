# PHP Exceptions

This library takes a very cenvenient technique which I saw for the first time in [Alex Bilbie's OAuth2 Server](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server) class `OAuthServerException`.

## Sirius validators

I often (if not always) use exceptions with [Sirius Validation](https://github.com/siriusphp/validation) so this library also includes some custom validators I've created; most of which accept improvments.
